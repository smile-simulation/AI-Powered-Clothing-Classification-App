# TensorFlow Lite Image Classification in Flutter

This Flutter application utilizes **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** to classify images as **T-shirt**, **Shirt**, or **Shoes**. Users can capture or select an image, which is processed by a pre-trained TFLite model to predict its category.

## 🚀 Features
- **Capture Image** – Take a picture using the device camera.
- **Select from Gallery** – Pick an image for classification.
- **AI Model Prediction** – Uses TensorFlow Lite for real-time analysis.
- **Prediction Confidence** – Displays probability scores.
- **User-Friendly UI** – Simple interface with intuitive controls.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Flutter** – UI framework
- **TensorFlow Lite** – Machine learning model
- **image_picker** – Image selection
- **image** – Image processing

---

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Select an Image** – Capture from the camera or pick from the gallery.
2. **Preprocess Image** – Resize and normalize for model input.
3. **Run Model** – The TensorFlow Lite model predicts the category.
4. **Display Result** – Shows the classification (T-shirt, Shirt, or Shoes).
